=== Description ===
A plugin that provides an Java code completion view inside of Sublime Text 2.

=== Known issues and feature requests ===
Please go [[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open|here]] to see the currently known issues and feature request, or to file a new.

=== Prerequisites ===
  # You need to have java installed on your system and the java binary in your path

=== Installation ===
    # The easiest way to install this plugin is via the excellent Package Control Plugin
    ## See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control#Installation
    ### Once package control has been installed, bring up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    ### Type Install and select "Package Control: Install Package"
    ### Select SublimeJava from the list. Package Control will keep it automatically updated for you
    ## If you don't want to use package control, you can manually install it
    ### Go to your packages directory and type:
    ####        git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava SublimeJava
    # You most likely want to configure the "sublimejava_classpath" setting to your own

=== Usage ===
Once installed it'll try to provide reasonable completion suggestions when you trigger autocompletion.

At the first install, it can take some time to create the database and you might see a SublimeJava
[[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava/issues/6|window popping up]] as it is caching some classes.

It can also take some time to cache classes the first time they are accessed.

If you find that the cache is out of date, it can be cleared by:
    # Opening up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    # Type in SublimeJava
    # Choose the "SublimeJava: Clear Cache" entry
